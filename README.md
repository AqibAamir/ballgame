This code creates a simple 2D game using Pygame where the player controls a basket to catch falling objects and power-ups. It initializes the game environment with screen dimensions, colors, and sounds, then defines classes for the basket, falling objects, and power-ups. The game features a start screen, a pause screen, and a game over screen, managing gameplay by detecting collisions, updating scores, and changing game levels. The main game loop handles user inputs, object movements, drawing on the screen, and updating scores while ensuring the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second.
